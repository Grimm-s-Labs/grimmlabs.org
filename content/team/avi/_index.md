By day, I labor for Amazon. By night, I'm a wannabe systems programmer who definitely isn't obsessed with Rust and Zig (I just happen to spend 40 hours a week fighting the borrow checker, okay?!). Currently building arena allocators and async runtimes with anime-themed variable names because if the compiler's gonna yell at me about lifetimes, my code might as well look kawaii.
