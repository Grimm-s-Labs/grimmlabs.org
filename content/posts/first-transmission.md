We have successfully migrated our systems. 

This is the first transmission from the new Grimm Labs architecture. Our goal remains unchanged: pure, unadulterated experimentation.

## What's Next?

We are currently stabilizing the `Project Void` memory modules and preparing for the next phase of `Entropy V1`.

Stay tuned.
