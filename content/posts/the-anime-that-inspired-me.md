Looking at youtube the algoritm thorws me again a old [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGsvHRyiTG0) i see a while ago about a anime called _A Place Further Than the Universe_ (or Sora Yori to keep it short), i never do a blog post before but i think it's worth make a recomendation about it, even with grimms lab phylosophy of experiment and research.

Sora Yori at first glance looks like a moe anime with cute girls, but is a stage for something better, more inspirational, in the first episode we are introduced to one of the girls of most people could relate, because she was someone that feels she is not enjoying her youth, wanting to achieve something big, daydreaming, but skipping it to another day, another day, another day and never doing it.

In this monotony and feel of insecure of _Am i really spending right my best days?_ change when we get introduced to another girl, where tells about her dream to go to Antartica, and the episodies goes we facing how they will try to face such a travel, it's not easy, they disagree, facing all the odds they start to make a more strict bonds and friendship, i let the rest to find out by yourself because, i think it's worth you watch and experience all by yourself.

> What's this anime have something in common with grimm labs?

It's about the message: do something, do something you want, some idea you have at a time where you keep only in mind saying _someday i will do it_ and neve does. Time to time i remember this anime, i almost get a warn and cozy touch and remember to myself to keep going, i consider myself a people without dreams, but it's a anime to teach my i still can do great things, that brings my joy, chalenges me etc.

Here in Grimms lab as somethink like this, to take a idea or a point on interest and make a project or a blog talking about it. This was i have to tell today, see ya.
